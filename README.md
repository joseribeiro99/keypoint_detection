# Keypoint detection
Work in progress

# Requirements
Used Python version: 3.10

Used libraries and versions are described on requirements.txt

# Work that still needs to be done:
    - Increase dataset size, important because it's not enough
        - The output is too complex for this little images
    - Try to improve the code
    - Try to run longer
    - Try different parameters and pretrained networks
    - Add testing process
    - Add prediction process including showing the image and the predicted point
    - Add model saving and model loading
    - If there's time: 
        - Try to give modularity to the code
            - Instead of ipynb create python files for each specific task
